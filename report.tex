\chapter{Introduction}\label{cha:introduction}

\section{Motivation}\label{sec:motivation}

In 1874 --- 4 years after his death --- John Papworth's \textit{Ordinary of British Armorials} was
published~\autocite{collins_1942}. In this work, he recorded approximately 50,000 entries of
descriptions of families' coats of arms, none annotated.

This honours project would make it possible to have these descriptions, or \textit{blazons} as they
are termed in heraldry (see~\ref{sec:heraldry}), drawn freely for people to view. This has
potential application for ancestry companies that build family trees for people. Given the blazon,
they would be able to construct the shields visually.

\section{Contributions}\label{sec:contributions}

In this honours project, my contributions included:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Drawing the charges and quarters used on the shield, \textit{escutcheon},
  \item Writing the base web server and
  \item Writing the quarter and charge drawing algorithm
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Background}\label{cha:background}

\section{Heraldry}\label{sec:heraldry}

Many families, countries and organisations --- primarily in Europe --- have coats of arms. At the
centre of a coat of arms is a shield known as an \textit{escutcheon}. The language used to describe
how the escutcheon is to be drawn is known as a \textit{blazon}. Blazons have been used since the
Norman conquest and have been refined to a regular language in the process~\autocite{boutell_1864},
although, as John Brooke-Little said, ``many of the supposedly hard and fast rules laid down in
heraldic manuals [including those by heralds] are often ignored.''~\autocite{brooke_little_1985}
This flagrant disregard for the rules introduces difficulty in parsing the blazons as the language
loses some of its regularity.

Blazons have a few key attributes:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The \textit{field}, which is the background of the shield;
  \item \textit{Ordinaries}, which are geometric shapes (an example of which can be seen in
    Figure~\ref{fig:scrope});
  \item \textit{Charges}, which are small emblems, such as fleur-de-lis and lions;
  \item \textit{Variations}, which describe how the field or charge are patterned. Variations can
    indicate patterns such as chequered or coloured lines (an example can be seen in
    Figure~\ref{fig:blason_albert}); and
  \item \textit{Tinctures}, which are the colours and patterns for charges, ordinaries and fields.
\end{itemize}

\begin{marginfigure}

  \caption{The shield of the town of Albert, France. \textit{Barry of ten argent and
  gules}. Source:~\url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Blason_Albert.svg}}\label{fig:blason_albert}
\end{marginfigure}

The tinctures are derived from Norman French and are divided into 3 groups, typically known as
\textit{metals}, \textit{colours} and \textit{furs}. In British heraldry, the colours are derived
from Norman French and so the names appear archaic. In heraldry, blue is \textit{azure} and red is
\textit{gules} for instance. The metals are \textit{or} and \textit{argent} for gold and silver
respectively. Whilst the tinctures are linked to colours, the College of Arms does not which shade
of that colour is required for the tinctures, leaving it to the artist to
decide~\autocite{college_of_arms_faq}.

Blazons conventionally follow a form of starting with the \textit{tincture} or \textit{variation}
of the field. After the description of the field, \textit{ordinaries} and \textit{charges} are
named with their tinctures. An example of this is ``\textit{Purpure, a chief Gules}''. This blazon
describes an escutcheon with a field of \textit{purpure} (purple), with a \textit{Chief} ordinary
--- a bar across the top of the shield --- of \textit{gules} (red). This can be seen drawn by the
web app in Figure~\ref{fig:chief_example}.

  \def\svgwidth{0.8\linewidth}
  \input{graphics/chief_example.pdf_tex}
  \caption{\textit{Purpure, a chief Gules}.}\label{fig:chief_example}
\end{marginfigure}

% Take out the history lesson?
A simple --- but notable --- blazon is that of the Scrope family. In the 14th century, the Baron
Scrope brought a case action against Sir Roberts Grosvenor when he noticed that they both had the
same coat of arms. Many witnesses gave evidence in the case, including Geoffrey
Chaucer~\autocite{scrope_grosvenor}. The case was ultimately decided in Scrope's favour. The Scrope
coat of arms has a blazon of \textit{Azure, a bend Or}; a depiction of this as drawn by the web app
written for this project can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:scrope}.

\begin{marginfigure}

  \def\svgwidth{0.8\linewidth}
  \input{graphics/scrope.pdf_tex}
  \caption{The Scrope escutcheon; \textit{Azure, a bend Or}.}\label{fig:scrope}
\end{marginfigure}

%\pagebreak

Whilst the Scrope arms are prominent in heraldry, they are simplistic and indicative of
medi\ae{}val arms. Coats of arms became more complex as they developed through the centuries, with
instances of \textit{quarterly} shields, \textit{grand-quarterlies} --- quarterlies within
quarterlies --- and \textit{differenced} arms. \textit{Differenced} arms involve adding an
\textit{ordinary} over an existing coat of arms. This was typically used to differentiate similar
looking coats of arms, especially between father and sons. Common examples of differentiated
shields are seen in duchies' coats of arms, particularly those which were given to Charles II's
illegitimate children. Examples of more complex shields can be seen in
Figure~\ref{fig:complex_shields}.

    \input{graphics/quarterly_example.pdf_tex}
  }
  \caption{Some examples of more complex coats of arms.}\label{fig:complex_shields}
\end{figure*}

For a time, it was considered bad form to repeat a \textit{tincture} in a blazon, and use a
reference to the tincture's previous use. The Heraldic Society gives an example as such:
``\textit{`Azure on a fess argent three billets azure'} [would have been written as] \textit{`Azure
on a fess argent three billets of the first'}''. The `\textit{of the first}' refers to the field's
tincture of azure. This blazon describes a blue shield, with a white bar horizontally across the
middle with 3 white rectangles arranged along the bar. The Heraldic Society advocates repeating
tinctures to reduce ambiguity~\autocite{blazon_in_coa}.

\section{Related Works}%
\label{sec:related_works}

Whilst many escutcheons have been drawn and uploaded to WikiMedia in SVG format (some of which have
been used in this report), many appear to have been created in
Inkscape~\footnoteurl{https://inkscape.org/en/}, rather than being created programmatically.
Much work has been done in collecting and cataloguing blazons themselves --- namely John Papworth
as mentioned in Section~\ref{sec:motivation}.

\section{Summary}%
\label{sec:background_summary}

In this chapter, we covered basic heraldry, including core terminology, as well as works related to
the project. Core heraldry terminology includes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textit{Escutcheon} --- the shield in the coat of arms;
  \item \textit{Field} --- the background of the escutcheon;
  \item \textit{Ordinaries} --- geometric shapes on the escutcheon;
  \item \textit{Charges} --- small emblems, such as fleur-de-lis and lions; and
  \item \textit{Tincture} --- the colours and patterns for charges, ordinaries and fields.
\end{itemize}
